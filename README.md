# ~ the beginning of my (logan silvers) - algorithms portfolio ~
## this is an update from week 1
### i am coding a readme
Your first set of examples to add to your portfolio are ones that show your understanding of big O notation.
Write your own code. You can use the material from this week as a guide, but the resulting code should be your own original creation.
Create methods that show:
Constant O(1)
Linear O(n)
Quadratic O(n2)  
The default language is C#.
In each method include comments that explain how your method demonstrates the concept.
GitHub Repo 
Readme.md that begins your class portfolio
Three methods (demonstrating constant, linear, and quadratic time) with comments that explain how your code shows your understanding of the concept.
### this is how week1 went for me:
I thought it was way more difficult for me to do the quiz than it was for me to do the examples. I thought I finally understood the concepts more when I was coding them and I think that the quiz was really tough for me because it was a lot of reading.
I am happy that this took a shorter amount of time than the full 9 hours // I was really worried about that becuase my programming 3 class only has one assignment so far and it is taking a long long long long amount of time.
