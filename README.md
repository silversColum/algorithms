## this is an update from week 1
### i am coding a readme
Your first set of examples to add to your portfolio are ones that show your understanding of big O notation.
Write your own code. You can use the material from this week as a guide, but the resulting code should be your own original creation.
Create methods that show:
Constant O(1)
Linear O(n)
Quadratic O(n2)  
The default language is C#.
In each method include comments that explain how your method demonstrates the concept.

GitHub Repo 
Readme.md that begins your class portfolio
Three methods (demonstrating constant, linear, and quadratic time) with comments that explain how your code shows your understanding of the concept.
